## OWASP Top 10 Review

**A03:2021-Injection**
- **Status:** Mitigated
- **Reason:** The application uses Spring Data JPA for all database interactions, which uses parameterized queries by default, effectively preventing SQL Injection.

**A01:2021-Broken Access Control**
- **Status:** Not Applicable
- **Reason:** The application is a single-user tool without authentication or user roles. All users have access to all functionality by design.

**A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
- **Status:** Checked
- **Reason:** Dependencies were analyzed using `mvn dependency:check`. No critical vulnerabilities were found in the current versions.
