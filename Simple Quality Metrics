Simple Quality Metrics
Defect Density Calculation
Module: TaskController.java
Lines of Code: 50
Defects Found: 2

Defect Density = Number of defects / Lines of Code
Defect Density = 2 / 50 = 0.04 defects per LOC

Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
Total Operating Time: 10 hours
Number of Failures: 2

MTTF = Total operating time / Number of failures
MTTF = 10 / 2 = 5 hours
